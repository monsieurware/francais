            <div class="intro-box">
                <strong>The truth about story design:</strong> A mediocre story about a student's genuine interest will outperform a technically perfect story about a generic topic every time. But when we combine authentic student voice with intentional craft, we create something extraordinary—stories that students want to read repeatedly, that model target structures organically, and that honor both linguistic development and human complexity.

            <div class="section">
                <h2 class="section-title">🎯 The Five Non-Negotiables of Special Person Stories</h2>
                
                <div class="principle-card">
                    <h3>1. Jump Right Into the Action</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The principle:</strong> Skip the exposition. Begin in the middle of a moment, a feeling, a decision. Students lose interest when stories begin with "María is 16 years old. She lives in Chicago. She has brown hair." They engage when stories begin with "María stares at her overflowing closet, suddenly disgusted."
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 12px;">
                        <strong>Why this matters linguistically:</strong> Action-driven openings immediately provide context clues for comprehension. Students infer meaning from verbs and situations rather than wading through static descriptions. This aligns with how brains naturally acquire language—through dynamic context, not vocabulary lists.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>The principle:</strong> Abstract language is harder to acquire than concrete, sensory language. When we write "Marcus feels nervous," we miss an opportunity. When we write "Marcus's hands shake as he reaches for the microphone," students see the nervousness—and acquire language through imagery rather than translation.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 12px;">
                        <strong>The neuroscience:</strong> Mirror neurons fire when we read sensory details, creating embodied understanding. Students don't just decode words—they experience the story physically, which accelerates acquisition and retention.

                        <strong>The principle:</strong> Stories should sound like they're told by a real human with opinions, quirks, and a distinct way of seeing the world—not generated by a committee or a textbook publishing house. Voice creates connection, and connection drives acquisition.

                        <strong>The principle:</strong> Dialogue shouldn't sound like written language read aloud. It should sound like actual speech—with interruptions, contractions, fragments, and the messy authenticity of real conversation. This is where students hear language in use, not language on display.

                    <p style="margin-top: 12px;">
                        <strong>The pedagogical value:</strong> Dialogue naturally provides repetition, circumlocution, and negotiation of meaning—exactly what drives acquisition. Plus, students love reading dialogue because it feels immediate and accessible.

                        <strong>The principle:</strong> Stories should end with resonance—a moment of insight, a decision, a change, a question that lingers. Avoid the "and then I went home and went to sleep" ending that drains all meaning from what came before.

                        <strong>The pedagogical opportunity:</strong> Meaningful endings create cognitive "stickiness." Students remember stories that made them feel something or think differently. That emotional resonance becomes the hook for all the language structures embedded in the story.

                                "If someone had told Mia three years ago that she'd obsess over a dance team acceptance message, she would have laughed. Back then, dance was just movement—a way to burn energy, nothing more. But somewhere between the endless practices and the ache in her muscles, something shifted. It wasn't that dance became important; it's that Mia couldn't imagine who she'd be without it. So when the notification appeared, what terrified her wasn't rejection—it was the possibility that they'd seen something in her she wasn't sure existed."

                                Notice: Conditional (would have laughed), subjunctive implied (something she wasn't sure existed), sophisticated connectors (somewhere between, it's that), abstract concepts (identity, possibility, self-perception). This is AP/IB-level complexity while maintaining narrative drive.

                    <p style="color: #555; margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 1.8;">
                        In TPRS (Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling), we target 1-3 high-frequency structures and recycle them throughout a compelling narrative. Special Person stories can incorporate this principle: identify key verbs, phrases, or structures you want students to acquire, then weave them naturally through the student's authentic story.
